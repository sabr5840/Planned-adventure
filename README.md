# Interactive Story Adventure

This interactive story takes you through an adventure into ancient ruins where you search for a legendary crystal. Each decision you make will lead you down different paths, uncovering new mysteries, dangers, or potential rewards.

## Project Description

This JavaScript project is an interactive narrative experience implemented for web browsers. It uses plain JavaScript to manage the flow of the story through various "nodes" or decision points, each representing a part of the story. The user makes choices that dictate the direction the story takes, with each choice leading to a new node and unfolding the story further.

## Features

Dynamic Story Progression: The story changes based on user choices, leading to multiple story endings.
Node-based Story Structure: Each point in the story is a node that the player can interact with by making a choice.
Rich Narrative: The adventure includes exploring ruins, solving riddles, and making critical decisions that could end the adventure or lead to greater discoveries.

## Structure of the Code
The project consists of the following parts:

HTML File (index.html): Contains the basic structure of the webpage and links to the JavaScript file.
JavaScript File (script.js): Contains all the logic for the node definitions, story progression, and handling user choices.
CCS File (style.css): Contains style for the webpage.
